1st iteration (1:17 minutes): more or less a fail. Resulted in a straight Space Invaders.

2nd iteration (3:59 minutes): when pointing this out, model created again a Space Invaders, but with wavy alien movements. Plus, a bug that randomly freezes the game (unknown cause).

3rd to 5th iteration (~4 minutes each): the random freeze could not be fixed

Stopped experiment.
