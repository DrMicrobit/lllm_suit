1st iteration (1:10): a Space Invaders Game. Buggy (enemies don't shoot, slow enemy movement)

2nd iteration (7:03): still a Space Invaders Game. Still no enemies hooting, still slow enemy movement.

Stopped experiment.

One reason for very long 2nd iteration could be incompatibility of model to what Clone expects. There were multiple message like the following "*The model used search patterns that don't match anything in the file. Retrying...*"
