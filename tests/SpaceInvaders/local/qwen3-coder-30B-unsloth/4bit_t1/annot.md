Probably best local version. Smooth anim, starfield!
Plus:
- overall aesthetics of screen and text
- aliens have 'eyes'
- a moving starfield!
- score counter
- player has only 1 life

Bugs:
- the player can spam shots, laserlike
- the start button is too low on some browsers, almost hidden
- there are no waves: when the player has shot all aliens, a message appears with "You win", and the possibility to restart the game
