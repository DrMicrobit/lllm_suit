initial version 1 minutes 13 seconds. Nice aesthetics, but aliens move too slow.
- two additional fixing rounds (each 7 seconds) and aliens move fast enough, although jerky
- then: bug uncovered, when all aliens are shot no next wave appears. Fixing this took 20s.
- then: I notice that the wave difficulty does not increase, every wave runs at the same speed. Asking the model to "add a display for alien speed" not only adds said display, but the model suddenly realises the bug all by itself and fixes it. Oh wow.
- one last try to fix the jerky movement being unsuccessful (1 minute 45 seconds)
