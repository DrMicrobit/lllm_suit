- Features: start screen, game over screen, 3 lives, score, high-score, sound.
- Bugs: small and game-breaking. E.g.: UFO cannot be shot, high-score stored only once. Weird: sometimes, hitting space bar to fire resets the whole game
- Graphics: nice shapes. Smooth animations. Starfield parallax right to left, funny.
- Comments: Initial version took 3:27. Would be very playable if not for game breaking space bar bug.


Didn't give Qwen3 Max the benefit of the doubt ... forgot to ask for corrections. Will redo.
