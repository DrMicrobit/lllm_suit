Initial version after 2:39 --> The code has two bugs: 1. the player ship cannot be moved, it is stuck to the right edge of the screen and 2. the alien formation does not reverse direction when hitting a border. Please fix.

Another ~3 minutes later, works.

- Features: start screen, game over screen, score, high score, lives, UFO, and sound.
- Bugs: None, even UFO can be shot.
- Graphics: very blocky aesthetics. But shapes are nice, 1st time I see different alien shapes. Starfield, but no parallax.
- Comments: Very playable, no remaining bugs.
