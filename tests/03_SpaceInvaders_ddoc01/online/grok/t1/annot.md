Initial version in under 2 minutes. However, non-functional. Indeed, Grok showed as one of the next options "Complete title and Game over screens". Maybe it was that?

2 minutes later, still not functional. --> When I open the file in a browser, I just see a dark blue background and a white rectangle frame, nothing else.

Another ~2 minutes later ... still non functional. Stopped this experiment.
