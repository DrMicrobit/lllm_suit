Initial version 2:04 --> When I open the file in the browser, I only see a dark screen and a blue rectangle, nothing else (no text, no nothing). Also, cannot start game, no reaction to key presses.

Fixed in 1:54. Then --> The player can shoot only once, afterwards not shots are fired.

Fixed in ~0:10. Did not ask to resolve remaining problems.

- Features: start screen, game over, 3 lives, score, high-score, sound.
- Bugs: display is small and not centered in browser. When aliens reach bottom, not immediate game over but successively killing remaining ships.
- Graphics: simplistic, but animated aliens. Smooth animation. Starfield parallax.
- Comments: Playable, good enough.
