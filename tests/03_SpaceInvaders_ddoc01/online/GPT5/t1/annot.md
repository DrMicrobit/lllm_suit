2:12 for first implementation. Broken. Asked this: "When opening the file in browser, I just see the playing field (score, highscore, lives, level, a star field, and short descriptions what key presses should do). But: nothing else. The game does not react to key presses, I cannot start the game."

Answer was broken fragments of code for "what to fix". Stopped experiment.
