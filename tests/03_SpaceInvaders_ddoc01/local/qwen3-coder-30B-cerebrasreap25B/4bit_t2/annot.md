Initial version 3:53. Typical Qwen sliding bug fixed by hand. Still problem: alien formation does not reverse direction at border (logic bug, direction is only a local variable) --> When reaching border, the alien formation does not reverse direction.

Not fixed, 2:47. Trying --> When reaching border, the alien formation does not reverse direction.

2:17. Not fixed. Stopping experiment.
