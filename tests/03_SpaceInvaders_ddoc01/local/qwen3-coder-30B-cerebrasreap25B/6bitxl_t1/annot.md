Intial 4:16. Actually quite good, just the laser-like fire is a misstep. --> The player can shoot continuously, with dozens and dozens of bullets. Make sure there can be at most one player bullet.

Fixed in 0:30.

Remaining bugs:
- shadow displays of score, high-score etc.
- UFO cannot be killed

Graphics simple, but functional. Very playable.
