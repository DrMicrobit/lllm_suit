Initial version 4:07. --> The following bugs need fixing: 1. bunker blocks are not destryed, neither by player shots nor alien shots

Partly fixed in 3:23. --> Now player shots destroy bunker blocks, but alien shots do not.

Fixed in 1:15. --> Player shots often pass through aliens. Sometimes they destroy the aliens, sometimes not.

Fixed in ~5 minutes. --> The fire function of the player is unreliable. Most of the time it works, but as the game progresses, it becomes more and more unreliable. To the point where pressing the space bar 10 times and more does not produce a single shot.

Not fixed, 3:34. --> Problem is not fixed. Please rewrite entire input logic using another approach.

Took 2:07. Better, but not entirely fixed. Stopping experiment here.

Remaining bugs:
- on rare occasions typical "slide down of alien formation" problem of Qwen3-coder
- player shooting unreliable
