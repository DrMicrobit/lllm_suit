Initial version took 3:24 minutes -->  When the invaders reach a border, they don't drop down by only one row, but immediately slide down to player level, leading to a game over.

- for the above error: ~10 trials (2-3 minutes each) could not solve problem.
- problem was a logic bug of alien movement, that kept invaders at same x-position, therefore immediately sliding down.
- manual fix, then continue. --> Player shots do not destroy bunker blocks
- 2:37 --> Bunkers are not restored on on start of new wave.
- 0:45 -- fixed

Still couple of bugs present: display placement, hit boxes not 100% accurate, UFO cannot be destroyed, but stopping here.

- Features: start screen, game over screen, 3 lives, score, high-score, sound.
- Bugs: Major, needed manual bugfix. Remaining minor. See above.
- Graphics: simplistic shapes, animated. Starfield parallax.
- Comments: very playable, but needed a few debug rounds.
