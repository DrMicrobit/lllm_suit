Initial run was caught in neverending loop. Stopped after 8 minutes.

New fresh run: 3:45 for initial version. Old problem of invaders moving to bottom of screen fixed manually. Then "Most shots of the player don't kill the aliens bit go right through."

- fixed in 2:29. Then --> The player ship does not react to key presses that should move it left or right. It only shoots with space. (mouse control works fine)
- Two trials, 3 minutes and 7 minutes, did not fix the problem

Other bugs: starfield; aliens move too much down before killing player

Ended experiment.
