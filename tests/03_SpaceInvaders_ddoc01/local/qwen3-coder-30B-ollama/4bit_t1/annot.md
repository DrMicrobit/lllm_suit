- initial 3:59. When opening the file in browser, I do not see a possibility to start the game.
- fix in 0:59 --> Aliens don't shoot?
- fix in 2:30 --> Only the blocks of the leftmost bunker are destroyed by shots? Shots go through the other bunkers.
- fix in 2:25 --> the score is shown as Nan?
- fix in 4:04.

Remaining bugs:
- main menu has "Game Over" text and restart button
- player ship hitbox too small (only blue triangle)
- some display elements overlapping
- no restart after game over.

- Features: start screen, no game over screen, 3 lives, score, high-score, sound.
- Bugs: Minor, see above.
- Graphics: nice shapes, though not animated. Starfield parallax.
- Comments: very playable, but needed a few debug rounds.
