Initial version 5:02 minutes. Does not start. --> When opening the file index.html in browser, I see a Game Over screen with the text "Press space or click to restart". Neither pressing space nor clicking starts the game. Also, shouldn't the game start with the title screen?

Cline / model got stuck in neverending loop. Multiple messages "The model used search patterns that don't match anything in the file.", each after 5 minutes.

Stopped experiment.
