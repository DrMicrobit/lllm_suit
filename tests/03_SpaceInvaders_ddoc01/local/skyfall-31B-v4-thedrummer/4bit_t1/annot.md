Very slow model. Also needed to reduce context to 30k to fit to VRAM.

Initial version 23:30 minutes. Game does not work. Different error messages on console (RangeError Audio and ReferenceError in the drawInvader and drawBunker functions).

Logic error between caller and drawInvaders and drawBunker functions, solved by manual fix.

Bugs:
- no sound
- invaders look weird
- invaders don't shoot
- player cannot move or shoot
- HUD displays are doubled

Stopped experiment.
