Intial version 4:20. Had "typical down slide error." Fixed manually. Then manually reduced size of aliens from 48x40 to 32x28. Then: "Player shots do not destroy bunker blocks. And bunkers are not reset at beginning of each wave."


- fixed in 3:08.

Very playable, stopped experiment. Remaining problems: no restart, low alien shot frequency.
