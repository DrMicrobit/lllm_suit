Initial version: 31 minutes (overspill to CPU) --> When I start the game. the aliens seem to be off-screen. Also, player shots do not destroy bunker blocks. Also, no sound though the title screen says the sound is on.

- 32 minutes. Sound there, but still no aliens. --> The aliens are still not visible when starting a wave. Rewrite the whole initial placement of an alien wave.
- 8 minutes --> not the problem. "Apparently the aliens are all at position 0 after moving."

Stopped experiment.
