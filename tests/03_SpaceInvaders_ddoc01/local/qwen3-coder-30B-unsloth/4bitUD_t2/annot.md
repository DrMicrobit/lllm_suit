Initial version 3:23. All movements are almost imperceptibly slow: aliens, player ship, player shots etc.

- Fixed in it 7:55. Then typical slide down error, fixed manually.

Very playable.

Remnaining bugs:
- only one wave, then automatic restart
- sound in game over screen
- nitpick: no starfield parallax
