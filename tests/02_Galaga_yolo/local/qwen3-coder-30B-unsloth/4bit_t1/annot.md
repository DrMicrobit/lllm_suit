1st iteration: 47s. Space Invaders game. Bugs: restart after game over does not work. All enemies killed should trigger new wave but does not.

2nd iteration (endless loop): initial response came after 1:56 minutes, but contained non-HTML, non-JavaScript text ("++REPLACE"). Cline then went into endless loop trying to fix it. Manual stop and fix resulted in still Space Invaders game, with same bugs.
