I lost my notes for this experiment, it was the very first I perfomed locally.

I remember getting a pretty good Space Invaders clone without  obvious errors. I then decided to write something like this to the model "This is not Galaga, this is Space Invaders." I did tghis in several iterations, in each the model added progressively complex alien movement patterns, but no attack patterns.

Interesting result, albeit not Galaga :-)
